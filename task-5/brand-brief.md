# Phase 1 Brand Brief & Content Strategy

## 1. Executive Snapshot
- **Positioning statement:** TriClaw is the premium triathlon control center that fuses pro-grade data, masters-specific coaching insight, and community accountability to help age-groupers PR without burning out.
- **Primary audience clusters:**
  1. **Competitive Age-Group Achievers (30–45, Sub-11 aspirants).** Tech-forward, want marginal gains, limited time.
  2. **Comeback Masters (40–55, injury returners).** Care equally about joy/longevity as PRs.
  3. **Time-Crunched Prosumer (late 20s–30s).** Balancing career/family; need efficient plans and finance transparency.
- **Credibility proof points:**
  - Built by multi-discipline coaching staff and data analysts (TriDot-style rigor without the black box).
  - Live diagnostic tools (fueling calculators, budget planners) prove expertise on day one.
  - Community structures (Race Control live calls, peer Slack) show it’s more than static PDFs.

## 2. Audience & Jobs-to-Be-Done
| Persona | Functional JTBD | Emotional JTBD | Triggers/Barriers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Competitive Achiever | Cut 10–15 minutes off 70.3 without extra hours; prove ROI of gear and nutrition choices. | Feel like an elite with a data-backed plan tailored to their body. | Trigger: plateaued FTP/run pace; Barrier: skepticism toward generic plans, distrust of hype. |
| Comeback Master | Rebuild consistency with injury-aware training and fueling protocols. | Trust their body again and feel represented (esp. female masters). | Trigger: cleared post-injury, wants structured return; Barrier: fear of overtraining, hormone needs ignored. |
| Time-Crunched Pro | Fit quality training into 8–10 hours/week while juggling career/family budget. | Confidence that every session matters and costs stay predictable. | Trigger: prepping for key race; Barrier: hidden costs, complex planning tools. |
