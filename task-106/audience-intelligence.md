# TriClaw Audience Intelligence Memo

## Core Athlete Snapshot
- **Age & tenure:** 48 years old with 30+ years in triathlon across aquathlon, duathlon, swim-run, sprint through Ironman distances.
- **Lifestyle reality:** Time-crunched due to family + work; winter often shifts to strength, MTB, ski, XC to stay fresh.
- **Motivation trigger:** Needs visible triathlon action/inspiration to regain energy; seeks flexible structure vs rigid plan.
- **A-race focus:** Sprint distance in Geneva (next 6–12 months).
- **Performance aim:** “Feel fast again without wrecking family/work,” leaning toward AG podium competitiveness when possible.

## Seasonal Rhythm Heuristic
| Phase | Months | What Happens | Content/Offer Need |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| Off-season reset | Nov–Dec | Sleep/recovery, strength, fun sport cross-training. | Low-pressure content, strength/MTB ideas, motivation check-ins.
| Base ignition | Jan–Mar | Start to move again, rebuild consistency. | Flexible plans, “one key session/week” prompts, momentum trackers.
| Build to race | Apr–May | Volume/quality ramp; race specificity. | Sprint-focused quality workouts, pacing/fueling calculators.
| Race stretch | Jun–Sep | Sprints through Ironman; multiple events. | Quick race-week stress tests, transition refreshers, aero/power nudges.
| Shoulder season | Oct | Debrief, maintain with fun races (XC, road). | Reflection frameworks, data recaps, off-season playbook.

## Format & Channel Preferences
- **Tools already used:** Garmin ecosystem; Notion is a non-starter (“no one uses Notion for triathlon”).
- **Content formats loved:** YouTube/podcast storytelling, short actionable dashboards; printable PDFs ok but must be sharp.
- **Personalized dashboards:** Appreciated when practical (built one for spouse); must import/export easily (CSV/Google Sheets).
- **Social hooks:** Drawn to pro insights, what elite athletes are doing, quick data snippets. IG is tri-specific; X/podcasts for deeper takes.

## Offer & Pricing Signals
- **€149 reaction:** Too steep for a static bundle; expectation would be too high vs value perceived. (Despite willingness to impulse-buy a €6k bike, informational products must drastically overdeliver.)
- **Purchase trigger:** Clear promise of “tell me the key session I need this week” personalized by race timeline; flexible structure that adapts when life intervenes; zero fluff.
- **Big turn-offs:** Generic templates, testimonials from random age-groupers, overlong manifestos, anything that feels like a thesis instead of action.

## Product Implications
1. **Weekly Key Session Drops:** Email or dashboard tile that surfaces *one* must-do workout per discipline + optional swap per week.
2. **Flex Mode Planning:** Workouts tagged with “Time-crunched”, “Standard”, “Stretch” options so missed sessions don’t break the plan.
3. **Pro Insight Overlays:** Use short data cards (“Here’s how Kristian Blummenfelt handles race-week fueling”) instead of AG testimonials.
4. **Media Layer:** Pair PDFs/Sheets with 2–3 minute Loom or audio explainers for each phase; optional podcast snippet.
5. **Price Framing:** Consider €59–€99 entry for Seasonal Playbook with upgrade path once real traction/proof is shown.

## Next Research Hooks
- Validate if weekly inbox “key session” cadence + seasonal prompts is compelling enough for email signups.
- Test whether Garmin-compatible FIT/Workout Builder exports would justify higher pricing tiers.
- Explore sponsorship tie-ins (gear, fueling brands) that align with the pro-content appetite.
