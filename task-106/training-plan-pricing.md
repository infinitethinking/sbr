## 2. Observations & opportunities

1. **Race-ready blueprints** priced between $150–$250 are common for 70.3/IM. Few offer the “coachless operating system” with calculators + dashboards that TriClaw provides → TriClaw can anchor at the top of that band.
2. **Single-session commerce is underdeveloped**. Where it exists, pricing is a la carte ($2–$5) but lacks context (no fueling notes, brick cues). Opportunity to sell premium “Session Kits” with pacing + fueling overlays for $9–$15 each or bundled mini-stacks.
3. **Subscriptions vs one-off**: Many platforms lock users into monthly fees. TriClaw’s async product can combine a premium one-time playbook with optional add-ons (bricks, tune-ups) to avoid subscription fatigue.

## 3. Draft pricing strategy

### Core product (Task 101)
- **TriClaw Seasonal Playbook**: €189 one-time (anchor vs $180–$250 IM plans). Justification: includes Sprint + 70.3 variants, fuel/pacing calculators, dashboard templates, race-week scripts. Offer €219 “Pro Pack” once checkout automation (Task 105) adds onboarding video + update channel.

### Lead magnet → Tripwire (Task 103)
- **Race-Week Stress Test**: free download (email gate). Upsell immediately to a €29 “Race-Week Execution Kit” (expanded checklist, gear checklist, 30-min video). Acts as low-ticket converter.

### Single-session marketplace (new idea)
- **Session Kits** (digital cards + fueling/pacing overlays + printable cues):
  - Key Bricks Pack (3 workouts) — €39
  - Swim Pop Pack (5 CSS/VO2 sessions) — €25
  - Single a la carte session — €12
- Each kit includes: structured workout (.zwo/.erg + PDF), fueling matrix, pacing notes, RPE fallback, and “When to deploy” guidance.

### Subscription / update channel (optional future)
- **TriClaw Ops Feed** (Telegram/Discord) — €15/mo for weekly “Session of the Week,” taper/heat adjustments, and Q&A drops. Works as continuity revenue.

## 4. Next actions

1. Validate pricing with existing audience intel (Task 106 memo). Identify willingness-to-pay ranges mentioned in interviews.
2. If approved, bake price points into landing site copy + checkout flow (Task 102 + 105).
3. Scope Session Kit production workflow (template, file outputs) if we greenlight marketplace.
