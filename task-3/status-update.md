# Status Update – Task 3

## Summary
- Task originated as an intake workflow test with no explicit deliverable. Intake automation steps completed successfully.

## Blocker (unchanged)
- Awaiting requester confirmation on whether additional work is needed or if the test can be marked complete.

## Proposed Resolution
1. If the test was the only requirement, approve closure.  
2. If another deliverable is required, please specify scope, format, and due date.
