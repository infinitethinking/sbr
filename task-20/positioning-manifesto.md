# TriClaw Positioning Manifesto (Phase 1 Focus)

## Core Conviction
TriClaw delivers premium training toolkits for working triathletes who want to finish proud—and often faster—without blowing up their lives. We sell beautifully designed, data-aware training plans (Sprint/Oly/70.3) bundled with fueling guides, budgeting clarity, and celebration-ready storytelling assets. The near-term mission is simple: build trust, grow an audience, and convert them into paying plan customers via a polished website, newsletter, and social cadence.

## What We Bring (That Others Don’t)
1. **Plan Quality + Packaging**
   - Not just PDFs. Each plan ships with interactive spreadsheets (training load, fueling, cost), baseline-testing guides, and drag-and-drop web/social assets so athletes can share their journeys.
2. **Masters & Celebration-First Lens**
   - We explicitly design for masters athletes and celebration finishers with money to spend—time-efficient strength/recovery blocks, hormone-aware tips, concierge gear advice.
3. **Financial Transparency**
   - Every toolkit includes budget planners, sponsorship pitch templates, and guidance on where to splurge or save—no other training product does this.
4. **Strength & Recovery Embedded**
   - Each plan contains micro strength sessions, recovery checklists, and recommended partner gear (Hyperice, Tonal, The Feed) so athletes don’t have to research elsewhere.
5. **Story-Ready Experience**
   - Athletes get recap templates, social caption starters, and landing-page copy, making it easy to brag while promoting our brand organically.

## Narrative Pillars
1. **Control the Chaos** – Our planning spreadsheets and checklists help athletes fit training into real life.
2. **Celebrate the Finish** – Finishing is heroic; we supply the brag kits and photo/story prompts.
3. **Masters Momentum** – Aging up with smart strength/recovery is an advantage, not a liability.
4. **Earned Luxury** – Premium design, concierge tone, and curated gear picks make the experience feel worth paying for.

## Proof Points (Phase 1 Deliverables)
- **Lead Magnet Toolkit:** Multi-distance plans + fueling matrices + baseline tests + strength/recovery protocols + budgeting sheets + storytelling templates.
- **Website & Funnel:** Beautiful landing page, content hub, and email capture that echo On-level polish.

## Rally Cry
