# Project X Deck Build – Notes

## Slides to include
1. Title & context
2. Objectives & success metrics
3. Stakeholder map
4. Conversion bottlenecks
5. Customer/ops pain points
6. Workstream overview (A–D)
7. Timeline & owners

## Visual ideas
- Funnel visualization highlighting drop-off between plan selection and checkout.
- Swimlane timeline mapping workstreams vs. weeks 1–12.
- Iconography for each workstream (experience, channels, ops, measurement).

## Data needed
- Latest funnel conversion data (Jan–Feb 2026).
- Lead volume by channel.
- Store inventory latency metrics.
- NPS verbatim snippets (with permission).

## Open questions
- Are there mandated brand templates for Y decks? Need confirmation.
- Do we have baseline CAC payback for pilot markets?
- Who owns the weekly exec steering deck updates after kickoff?
