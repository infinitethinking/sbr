# Deck Outline – Project X for Y

## 1. Cover & Context
- **Title:** Project X – Accelerating omni-channel readiness for Y
- **Date:** 22 February 2026
- **Audience:** Y ELT (CEO, COO, CPO) + Growth LT
- **Author:** C-3PO (Strategy), contact: c3po@openclaw.dev
- **Context blurb:** “How we unify product, marketing, and ops over the next 90 days to unlock the Q2 launch milestone.”

## 2. Objectives
1. Align on the business question: “What must Y launch by Q2 to 2× conversion from pilot markets?”
2. Define success metrics for Project X (activation rate, CAC payback, NPS uplift).
3. Secure executive sponsorship for scope, resourcing, and decision cadence.

## 3. Audience / Stakeholders
- **Primary decision makers:** CEO (final go/no-go), COO (budget), CPO (product priorities).
- **Secondary influencers:** VP Marketing, VP Sales, Head of Ops Enablement, Head of CX.
- **Implementation teams:** Growth pods (Acquisition & Lifecycle), Product squads (Checkout, Onboarding), RevOps, Data Science.
- **External partners:** Creative agency, lifecycle automation vendor.

## 4. Insights / Current State
- **Conversion bottleneck:** Pilot markets plateaued at 3.2% funnel conversion vs. 5% goal; 60% of drop-off occurs between “plan selected” and “checkout complete.”
- **Channel fragmentation:** Only 35% of qualified leads receive consistent cross-channel messaging (email, SMS, in-app), creating inconsistent value propositions.
- **Operational gap:** Retail inventory sync lags 48 hours, preventing real-time BOPIS (buy-online-pickup-in-store) promises.
- **Customer sentiment:** NPS from pilot cohorts = +12 (target +30); verbatims point to “confusing onboarding” and “no single point of accountability.”

## 5. Proposed Approach
- **Workstream A – Experience Design:** Redesign onboarding flow, unify messaging, and introduce milestone-based nudges. *Owner:* Product/Design lead. *Timeline:* Weeks 1–6.
- **Workstream B – Channel Operations:** Implement centralized campaign brief template, enforce SLAs for lifecycle handoffs, and deploy audience-sync automation. *Owner:* Growth Marketing lead. *Timeline:* Weeks 1–8.
- **Workstream C – Omni Ops Enablement:** Integrate inventory API, pilot BOPIS promise, and train store teams on new scripts. *Owner:* Ops Enablement lead. *Timeline:* Weeks 2–10.
- **Workstream D – Measurement & Insights:** Stand up KPI dashboard (conversion, CAC payback, NPS) and weekly exec readout. *Owner:* Data Science lead. *Timeline:* Weeks 1–12.
- **Resource needs:** 2 dedicated PMs, lifecycle engineer, BI analyst bandwidth, vendor professional services for inventory integration.

## 6. Recommendations
1. **Adopt a “single promise” narrative** across marketing, product, and store scripts; route every asset through a shared brief to enforce consistency (expected +1.2pt conversion uplift).
2. **Sequence onboarding improvements before BOPIS pilots** to prevent operational drag; freeze net-new experiments until Workstream A milestones ship.
3. **Stand up a weekly exec steering** (CEO/COO/CPO) with a decision log to unblock scope and budget in <72 hours.
4. **Fund the lifecycle engineering headcount immediately** to avoid pushing automation work into Q3.

## 7. Next Steps / Requests
- **Decisions needed this week:** Approve Workstream resourcing (2 PMs + lifecycle engineer), green-light inventory vendor SOW, confirm cadence for steering committee.
- **Dependencies:** Data Science to deliver baseline KPI dashboard schema by Friday; Ops Enablement to confirm store participation list.
- **Meetings:** Kickoff on Monday 24 Feb; weekly steering Wednesdays 09:00 CET; workstream stand-ups Tue/Thu.
