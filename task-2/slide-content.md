# Project X Deck – Draft Slide Copy

## Slide 1 – Title & Context
**Project X: Accelerating Omni-Channel Readiness for Y**  
Date: 22 Feb 2026 · Audience: Y ELT (CEO/COO/CPO) & Growth LT  
“Unifying product, marketing, and operations over the next 90 days to unlock the Q2 launch milestone.”

## Slide 2 – Objectives & Metrics
1. Align on what must launch by Q2 to 2× conversion in pilot markets.  
2. Lock success metrics: activation rate ≥ 55%, CAC payback ≤ 9 months, NPS +30.  
3. Secure executive sponsorship for scope, resourcing, and weekly decision cadence.

## Slide 3 – Stakeholder Map
- **Deciders:** CEO (vision/go), COO (budget), CPO (product scope).  
- **Influencers:** VP Marketing, VP Sales, Head of Ops Enablement, Head of CX.  
- **Implementers:** Growth pods (Acquisition, Lifecycle), Product squads (Checkout, Onboarding), RevOps, Data Science, Retail Ops, creative agency.

## Slide 4 – Conversion Bottleneck
- Funnel: Lead (100%) → Qualified (45%) → Plan Selected (21%) → Checkout Complete (3.2% vs 5% goal).  
- 60% of drop-off between Plan Selected and Checkout due to fragmented onboarding, unclear value prop, manual checkout handoffs.

## Slide 5 – Customer & Ops Pain
- **Customer voice:** “I picked a plan but wasn’t sure what would happen next—no one followed up.” (NPS verbatim)  
- **Operational gap:** 48h retail inventory sync delay prevents real-time BOPIS promises, eroding trust.  
- **Experience impact:** Only 35% of qualified leads receive coordinated messaging across email/SMS/in-app.

## Slide 6 – Workstream Overview
- **A. Experience Design:** Redesign onboarding, milestone nudges, shared narrative.  
- **B. Channel Operations:** Central brief, SLA-driven lifecycle orchestration, automated audience sync.  
- **C. Omni Ops Enablement:** Inventory API integration, BOPIS pilot, store training.  
- **D. Measurement & Insights:** KPI dashboard, weekly exec readout, decision log.

1. **Single Promise Narrative:** Route every asset through one brief → expected +1.2pt conversion.  
2. **Sequence Experience Before Ops:** Freeze net-new experiments until onboarding ship; avoid dilution.
