# Pacing Sheet

Fill in the anchor tests below. Formulas assume metric units.

## Inputs

| Metric | Test Protocol | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Swim CSS (s / 100m) | 400 TT + 200 TT method |  | Use average pace |
| Bike FTP (W) | 20' test × 0.95 |  | from smart trainer or power meter |
| Run Threshold Pace (min/km) | 30' TT average |  | Equivalent to critical velocity |
| RPE readiness (1–10) | Morning check |  | Use to decide lane |

## Output targets

| Discipline | Finish Lane | Fast Lane | Podium Lane |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint Swim (race) | CSS + 4" | CSS + 2" | CSS + 1" |
| 70.3 Swim | CSS + 6" | CSS + 4" | CSS + 2" |
| Sprint Bike | 78–84% FTP | 84–88% FTP | 88–92% FTP |
| 70.3 Bike | 74–78% FTP | 78–82% FTP | 82–85% FTP |
| Sprint Run | Threshold + 12"/km | Threshold + 8"/km | Threshold + 4"/km |
| 70.3 Run | Threshold + 30"/km | Threshold + 20"/km | Threshold + 12"/km |

### Brick guidance

- If HR drifts >5% at given power, pull back one lane.
- Use RPE readiness <6 to cap at Finish lane regardless of metrics.

### Taper adjustments (Week 12)

- Swim pace: hold CSS, reduce volume 40%.
- Bike power: 3 × 3' openers at 100% FTP, rest race wattage.
- Run: 6 × 1' at 5K pace, plenty of easy jogging.
