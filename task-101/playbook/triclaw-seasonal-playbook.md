# TriClaw Seasonal Playbook

**Version:** 0.1 · **Focus athlete:** time-crunched age-grouper targeting sub-5h Sprint → 70.3 performances without hiring a coach.

This playbook packages everything needed to execute a 12-week block: macro structure, adaptive weekly templates, key sessions, fueling + pacing calculators, and race-week execution checklists. Sprint and 70.3 variants live inside the same operating system so you can scale load without rebuilding your life.

## 1. Quick-start checklist

1. **Pick your lane** (Finish, Fast, Podium) based on current consistency:
   - *Finish:* 4–5 sessions/week · 6–8 h (Sprint) / 9–11 h (70.3)
   - *Fast:* 6–7 sessions/week · 8–10 h (Sprint) / 11–13 h (70.3)
   - *Podium:* 8–9 sessions/week · 10–12 h (Sprint) / 13–15 h (70.3)
2. **Test anchors this week**: CSS 400 TT for swim, 20' FTP test on bike, 30' threshold test for run. Log in the pacing calculator.
3. **Schedule three anchors first** (Key Swim, Key Bike, Key Run). Drop endurance filler and strength after family/work blocks are on the calendar.
4. **Print / duplicate the dashboard** (Notion or CSV) and track subjective metrics (sleep, HRV, mood) daily.
5. **Run the Race-Week Stress Test** on Week 10 so you fix logistics before taper.

## 2. Block architecture (Weeks 1–12)

| Phase | Weeks | Intent | Load Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prime | 1–3 | Rebuild habits, reinforce technique, progressive strength | Keep intensity in Finish lane even if you plan to go Fast later |
| Build A | 4–6 | Raise aerobic floor, extend key sessions | Add low-cadence torque + broken tempo | 
| Build B | 7–9 | Specificity: bricks + fueling practice | Upgrade to Fast/Podium lane if readiness score \>= 7/10 |
| Peak + Taper | 10–12 | Sharpen pacing, absorb load, rehearse race-week | Week 11 = peak volume, Week 12 = 40% reduction |

---

## 3. Weekly backbone

| Day | Pillar Session | Optional Filler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Mobility + easy swim drills (1.2–1.8 km) | 20' core circuit |
| Tuesday | **Key Bike** (sweet spot → threshold) | 30' brick run (build weeks) |
| Wednesday | **Key Swim** (CSS build) | Strength 40' |
| Thursday | **Key Run** (broken tempo / track) | Evening easy spin |
| Friday | Technique swim or rest | Mobility + breathwork |
| Saturday | Long bike + race fueling practice | Short transition run |
| Sunday | Long run progression (fast finish) | Sauna/recovery |

## 7. Fueling & pacing calculators

- `fuel_map.csv`: ingest into Google Sheets / Notion for automatic gels/bottles count based on session duration + temperature.
- `pacing-sheet.md`: plug CSS/FTP/Threshold test data to convert to race-pace targets.

See accompanying files in `/task-101/playbook/`.

## 8. Transition & race-week checklist

1. **Bike:** torque checked, brake pads aligned, chain waxed, base bar tape clean.
2. **Bottles:** Label nutrition plan (Bike 1 = 90g carbs + 900 mg sodium; Bike 2 = 70g + 600 mg).
3. **Run bag:** socks rolled, gel count written on bib, hat/visor ready.
4. **Race-week timeline:**
   - T-7: Final race-specific brick.
   - T-5: Bike tune + tire inspection.
   - T-3: Carb load begins (8 g/kg).
   - T-2: Packet pickup & rack rehearsal.
   - T-1: 20' swim + strides, early dinner, lights out by 21:30.
5. **Stress Test (Week 10):** Use lead magnet doc to simulate sprint through transition and nutrition scenario; log gaps inside dashboard column `Issues to fix`.

## 9. Dashboard integration

- Duplicate `dashboard-template.csv` (coming next). Columns: Week, Day, Session, Goal, Lane (Finish/Fast/Podium), Planned Duration, Completed Duration, RPE, Fuel, Notes.
- Use filters per distance to quickly shift from Sprint → 70.3 without rewriting plan.
