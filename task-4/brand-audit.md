## 1. Global Race & League Platforms
### Ironman Group
- **Who they serve:** Global age-groupers chasing bucket-list finishes plus elites fighting for world titles.

- **Signals:**
  - Owns the full stack: race series, merch, media, training services (IM University). Cross-promotion keeps athletes in the ecosystem.
  - Mastery of fear-of-missing-out marketing (slot allocations, legends campaigns) that drives urgency and social proof.
  - Broadcast + documentary content (NBC specials, IRONMAN Live) turn participants into heroes, fueling repeat registrations.
  - Tiered offerings (70.3 vs. IM vs. branded camps) show how to ladder athletes up price points.
- **Takeaways:** We can borrow their narrative framing (ordinary people → finish-line legends) and limited-availability levers. Offer tiered experiences and highlight brag-worthy storytelling kits to tap the same psychology.


### World Triathlon
- **Who they serve:** Olympic-distance athletes and national federations from grassroots to WTCS elites.
- **Promise:** Official Olympic pathway with ranking points, standardized rules, and federation backing.
- **Signals:**
  - Operates like a federation media company—rights deals, sponsor showcases (NTT, ASICS), and development programs.
  - Heavy emphasis on equality (equal prize money, mixed relay) → good playbook for inclusive messaging.
  - Shared digital assets (WT Live, training plans) hint at how “official” resources can double as lead funnels.
- **Takeaways:** Certify our plans/tools with “TriClaw Approved Protocols” to mimic federation stamp; highlight inclusivity and Olympic-adjacent credibility.

- **Promise:** Short, TV-friendly formats with neon visuals, onboard telemetry, and team franchises.
- **Signals:**
  - Aggressive YouTube/TikTok strategy → millions of organic impressions.
  - City-based events + at-home eSports components show hybrid potential.
  - Sponsors (Zwift, Red Bull) buy into entertainment-first framing.
- **Takeaways:** Package our content with similar high-energy editing; use “season arcs” (e.g., 4-week challenge) to keep community hooked.

### PTO / T100 Tour
- **Who they serve:** Long-course pros and serious fans hungry for rivalries + data.
- **Promise:** Big purses, head-to-head storytelling, Netflix-ready rivalries.
- **Signals:**

- **Signals:**
  - Multi-format publishing (magazine, newsletters, podcasts, web) with rigorous gear testing and expert columns lends authority.
  - Deep relationships with pros and brands enable exclusive drops (training diaries, tech previews) that drive subscriptions.
  - Community storytelling (age-grouper profiles, club spotlights) gives readers social currency.
- **Takeaways:** Maintain editorial standards (fact-checked guides, expert contributors) and spotlight community stories alongside data. Offer premium content bundles (behind-the-scenes, tested gear lists) to mirror subscription value.

- **Who they serve:** Women and non-binary athletes across triathlon, gravel, trail.
- **Promise:** "Fueled by purpose" storytelling plus training resources that elevate underrepresented voices.

## Cross-Brand Patterns (Updated)
1. **Experiential scarcity sells.** Ironman slots, Supertri event passes, PTO fantasy games—limited access creates urgency.
2. **Editorial + utility fusion.** GTN/220 mix entertainment with actionable guides; Precision merges calculators with science explainers.
3. **Community rituals outperform ad spend.** CrossFit Opens, Zwift seasons, Feisty summits all drive organic growth.
4. **Telemetry storytelling wins.** PTO overlays, FORM goggles, Whoop strains—data becomes narrative fuel.
5. **Strength & recovery are no longer optional.** Purple Patch, Tonal, Hyperice bake them into every pitch; we must do the same.
6. **Affiliate + commerce flywheels sustain media.** 220 gear lists, GTN shop, Roka collabs—content + commerce go hand-in-hand.
7. **Cross-sport borrowing is table stakes.** Fans expect the Netflix/Peloton-level polish; even scrappy launches must nod to it.
